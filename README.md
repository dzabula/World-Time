The project was done as a pre-examination requirement in the second year of study.
This is my first web application.
It is built in Native PHP.
The project is an application that enables the publication of news.

It is accessed by authorized users, authorized users, moderators and administrators

Unauthorized users can only browse the news

Authorized users have the ability to:
- Commenting
- Responds to already existing comments
- Liking posts
- Filling out a survey for the purpose of evaluating news portals or applications.
Moderators have the ability to:
- Adding new announcements on the portal
- Viewing responses to completed surveys.
Administrators have the same capabilities as moderators with the addition of:
- Search all posts
- Updates to existing posts
- Ban/Reban of existing posts
- View all comments for an individual post.
- Ban/Reban of comments
- Deleting comments
- Search all users
- Ban/Reban of users
- Deleting users
- View all comments written by the user

All data that comes from the user to the server is verified by client and server validation.
The MySQL database was used.
The server code is written in Native PHP.
The client code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) was taken from the Internet with my modification


On this project I learned:
- Basics of PHP language
- MySQL database basics
- How to deliver or model my database
- What is a server language and how does server-client communication work in practice in a web application
- Use of sessions and cookies
- Improved knowledge of AJAX technology
- How do I connect the server code to the database server
- New knowledge in the field of http protocol
